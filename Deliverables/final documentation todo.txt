Your documentation should include a PDF writeup with at least the sections shown below. 
Figures, tables, a screencast, and screenshots are encouraged!

1) Project Description

2) Project Features

3) Usage 
(from the user's perspective; pretend you are giving this to a non-tech savvy friend to use)

4) Design and implementation details 
(from the developer's perspective; pretend you are giving this to a co-op you just hired to help you)

5) Your development log 
(you should keep this throughout your development process and not simply write it at the end!). 
Take notes about issues you encountered, where you went to resolve them, and what you did. 
If you find a bug, make a note of it and note how you solved it.
